## Service startup setup

By default, the SMA OpCon Agent for SQL service is set for an Automatic (Delayed Start) startup and for running under the local system account. If you want to change the default settings, perform the procedure in this section.

:::caution

SMA Technologies recommends leaving the SMA OpCon Agent for SQL service set to Automatic (Delayed Start) to avoid potential issues at startup time while other services and programs start up.

2. Click the **Administrative Tools** icon. The **Administrative Tools** window displays.

    - **Local System account**: If the service will run as the local system account, select this option to delete the default Domain User displayed in the text box.
